# ControlHome — Status

Resume point for whoever (human or agent) continues the work. Updated after every milestone.

## Done
- 2026-10-11 — Research (vendor APIs, stack) + approved phased plan (see `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`).
- 2026-10-11 — Preflight: Node 24.21.0 active via nvm-windows; Docker Desktop running (29.7.2, linux/x86_64);
  `ControlHome_Dev` created on umbrel SQL Server 2025 (compat 170, SIMPLE recovery); workflow-file push verified.

## In progress
- Milestone 0.1 — Skeleton and loop (`docs/plans/phase-0-foundation.md`).

## Decisions taken (defaults chosen without the user)
- Package pins: Microsoft.* 10.0.12 (local runtime is 10.0.10; servicing-compatible). TypeScript pinned `~6.0.3` (npm latest is 7.x, unsupported by vue-tsc).
- Line endings normalized to LF via `.gitattributes` (repo is Docker/Linux-first; user has `core.autocrlf=true`).
- Container port 8099 (dev API 5080, Vite 5173).
- Log-redaction of connector secrets (`KnownSecretsRedactor`) lands with the first secret-bearing connector (milestone 1.2), not 0.2.

## Needs you (non-blocking)
- Live validation of each vendor connector with your own accounts (`docs/connectors/LIVE-VALIDATION.md`, from Phase 2).
- Optional: enable branch protection on `main` + secret-scanning push protection (repo settings).
- Later: create the `controlhome-umbrel-store` repo; create a least-privilege `ControlHome_App` SQL login for production.
- SmartThings may require the paid Personal Plan ($4.99/mo) — decide when we reach milestone 2.3.

## Known failures
- (none)
